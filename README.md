# GITHUB-SEARCH
THIS IS A WEB APPLICATION WHICH GIVES THE TOP 'n' REPOSITORIES OF AN ORGANISATION ALONG WITH TOP 'm' COMMITTIES OF EACH OF THE REPOSITORIES. TOP REPOSITORIES ARE BASED ON THEIR FORK COUNT.
THIS IS DONE BY USING THE REST API v3 BY GITHUB  https://docs.github.com/en/rest.
HERE WE ACCESS THE DATA USING THE FETCH OPERATION IN JAVASCRIPT AND THEN IT ARRANGES ACCORDING TO THE FORK COUNT. THE JSON DATA IS STORED IN THE 'repo_list' ARRAY.
AT PRESENT THE WEB-APP MADE SO FAR ACCESSES THE DATA OF THE ORGANISATION ENTERED BY THE USER. IT THEN SORTS THE DATA ACCORDING TO THE FORK COUNT OF THE INDIVIDUAL REPISTORIES. AT PRESENT IT DOES NOT DO ANY ADDITIONAL FUNCTIONING BUT I AM WORKING ON IT AND WILL SOON DO THE FULL JOB. 
TO USE THIS WEB-APP SIMPLY FORK THE REPOSITORY. CLONE IT AND RUN THE index.html FILE USING A BROWSER.
